@article{Pesquita2009,
abstract = {In recent years, ontologies have become a mainstream topic in biomedical research. When biological entities are described using a common schema, such as an ontology, they can be compared by means of their annotations. This type of comparison is called semantic similarity, since it assesses the degree of relatedness between two entities by the similarity in meaning of their annotations. The application of semantic similarity to biomedical ontologies is recent; nevertheless, several studies have been published in the last few years describing and evaluating diverse approaches. Semantic similarity has become a valuable tool for validating the results drawn from biomedical studies such as gene clustering, gene expression data analysis, prediction and validation of molecular interactions, and disease gene prioritization. We review semantic similarity measures applied to biomedical ontologies and propose their classification according to the strategies they employ: node-based versus edge-based and pairwise versus groupwise. We also present comparative assessment studies and discuss the implications of their results. We survey the existing implementations of semantic similarity measures, and we describe examples of applications to biomedical research. This will clarify how biomedical researchers can benefit from semantic similarity measures and help them choose the approach most suitable for their studies.Biomedical ontologies are evolving toward increased coverage, formality, and integration, and their use for annotation is increasingly becoming a focus of both effort by biomedical experts and application of automated annotation procedures to create corpora of higher quality and completeness than are currently available. Given that semantic similarity measures are directly dependent on these evolutions, we can expect to see them gaining more relevance and even becoming as essential as sequence similarity is today in biomedical research.},

@book{Gan2007,
abstract = {Cluster analysis is an unsupervised process that divides a set of objects into homogeneous groups. This book starts with basic information on cluster analysis, including the classification of data and the corresponding similarity measures, followed by the presentation of over 50 clustering algorithms in groups according to some specific baseline methodologies such as hierarchical, center-based, and search-based methods. As a result, readers and users can easily identify an appropriate algorithm for their applications and compare novel ideas with existing results. The book also provides examples of clustering applications to illustrate the advantages and shortcomings of different clustering architectures and algorithms. Application areas include pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, information technology, image processing, biology, psychology, and marketing. Readers also learn how to perform cluster analysis with the C/C++ and MATLAB programming languages.Audience The following groups will find this book a valuable tool and reference: applied statisticians; engineers and scientists using data analysis; researchers in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data mining; and applied mathematicians. Instructors can also use it as a textbook for an introductory course in cluster analysis or as source material for a graduate-level introduction to data mining.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are a critical element of biological systems, and the analysis of interaction partners can provide valuable hints about unknown functions of a protein. In recent years, several large-scale protein interaction studies have begun to unravel the complex networks through which plant proteins exert their functions. Two major classes of experimental approaches are used for protein interaction mapping: analysis of direct interactions using binary methods such as yeast two-hybrid or split ubiquitin, and analysis of protein complexes through affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. In addition, bioinformatics predictions can suggest interactions that have evaded detection by other methods or those of proteins that have not been investigated. Here we review the major approaches to construct, analyze, use, and carry out quality control on plant protein interactome networks. We present experimental and computational approaches for large-scale mapping, methods for validation or smaller-scale functional studies, important bioinformatics resources, and findings from recently published large-scale plant interactome network maps.},

@article{Rosvall2009,
abstract = {Many real-world networks are so large that we must simplify their structure before we can extract useful information about the systems they represent. As the tools for doing these simplifications proliferate within the network literature, researchers would benefit from some guidelines about which of the so-called community detection algorithms are most appropriate for the structures they are studying and the questions they are asking. Here we show that different methods highlight different aspects of a network’s structure and that the the sort of information that we seek to extract about the system must guide us in our decision. For example, many community detection algorithms, including the popular modularity maximization approach, infer module assignments from an underlying model of the network formation process. However, we are not always as interested in how a system’s network structure was formed, as we are in how a network’s extant structure influences the system’s behavior. To see how structure influences current behavior, we will recognize that links in a network induce movement across the network and result in system-wide interdependence. In doing so, we explicitly acknowledge that most networks carry flow. To highlight and simplify the network structure with respect to this flow, we use the map equation.We present an intuitive derivation of this flow-based and information-theoretic method and provide an interactive on-line application that anyone can use to explore the mechanics of the map equation. The differences between the map equation and the modularity maximization approach are not merely conceptual. Because the map equation attends to patterns of flow on the network and the modularity maximization approach does not, the two methods can yield dramatically different results for some network structures. To illustrate this and build our understanding of each method, we partition several sample networks. We also describe an algorithm and provide source code to efficiently decompose large weighted and directed networks based on the map equation.},

abstract = {A key property of complex biological systems is the presence of interaction networks formed by its different components, primarily proteins. These are crucial for all levels of cellular function, including architecture, metabolism and signalling, as well as the availability of cellular energy. Very stable, but also rather transient and dynamic proteinprotein interactions generate new system properties at the level of multiprotein complexes, cellular compartments or the entire cell. Thus, interactomics is expected to largely contribute to emerging fields like systems biology or systems bioenergetics. The more recent technological development of high-throughput methods for interactomics research will dramatically increase our knowledge of protein interaction networks. The two most frequently used methods are yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening, a well established genetic in vivo approach, and affinity purification of complexes followed by mass spectrometry analysis, an emerging biochemical in vitro technique. So far, a majority of published interactions have been detected using an Y2H screen. However, with the massive application of this method, also some limitations have become apparent. This review provides an overview on available yeast two-hybrid methods, in particular focusing on more recent approaches. These allow detection of protein interactions in their native environment, as e.g. in the cytosol or bound to a membrane, by using cytosolic signalling cascades or split protein constructs. Strengths and weaknesses of these genetic methods are discussed and some guidelines for verification of detected protein-protein interactions are provided.},

@article{Pandey2008,
abstract = {Motivation: Extracting functional information from protein-protein interactions (PPI) poses significant challenges arising from the noisy, incomplete, generic and static nature of data obtained from high-throughput screening. Typical proteins are composed of multiple domains, often regarded as their primary functional and structural units. Motivated by these considerations, domain-domain interactions (DDI) for network-based analyses have received significant recent attention. This article performs a formal comparative investigation of the relationship between functional coherence and topological proximity in PPI and DDI networks. Our investigation provides the necessary basis for continued and focused investigation of DDIs as abstractions for functional characterization and modularization of networks. Results: We investigate the problem of assessing the functional coherence of two biomolecules (or segments thereof) in a formal framework. We establish essential attributes of admissible measures of functional coherence, and demonstrate that existing, well-accepted measures are ill-suited to comparative analyses involving different entities (i.e. domains versus proteins). We propose a statistically motivated functional similarity measure that takes into account functional specificity as well as the distribution of functional attributes across entity groups to assess functional similarity in a statistically meaningful and biologically interpretable manner. Results on diverse data, including high-throughput and computationally predicted PPIs, as well as structural and computationally inferred DDIs for different organisms show that: (i) the relationship between functional similarity and network proximity is captured in a much more (biologically) intuitive manner by our measure, compared to existing measures and (ii) network proximity and functional similarity are significantly more correlated in DDI networks than in PPI networks, and that structurally determined DDIs provide better functional relevance as compared to computationally inferred DDIs.
